{"name":"Openhantek","tagline":"","body":"### Description\r\nOpenHantek is a free software for Hantek (Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech) USB DSOs based on HantekDSO. The UI is written in C++/Qt 4 and uses OpenGL to draw the graphs. It was tested with the DSO-2090, test results with other models are welcome.\r\n\r\nOpenHantek has started as an alternative to the official Hantek DSO software for Linux users. At the moment it's basically running under Mac OS X too, but since this lacks udev you'll have to load the firmware by hand up too now.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
